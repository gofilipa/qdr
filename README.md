This is a script that "multiplies" keywords (such as "woman") by
computing word similarities within a source text.

The source text must be contained within the same directory as the
script. 

To run it, download the app and run the main.py file in your
terminal, passing in a plain text file (as the source text) and a term
(e.g. "woman") that you want to analyze.

For example, to analyize the term "woman" in Virginia Woolf's
*Orlando* ("orlando.txt"), use the following command:

```console
% python main.py orlando.txt woman
```

This project is *very much* in progress.
